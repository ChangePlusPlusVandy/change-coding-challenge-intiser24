About the codes - The "guessTheTweet.py" file contains the original task. I extended the code a bit to give users the chance to select any two twitter handles for the game in "guessTheTweetV2.py".

Feedback/Reflection - Thank you so much for this task!!! I've been teaching myself python over the last eight months, but I haven't had this much fun coding before. I had zero ideas about APIs before this project. It took like 4-5 days to get the twitter API, so I learned how to work with Spotify and LastFM APIs. I have so many API mini-project ideas I want to try now. Along the way, I also learned some basics of Tkinter, CSS, flask. I got so into it that coded 12 hours straight yesterday. Overall, this task felt overwhelmingly amazing and productive. I think you learn more by doing these projects than you ever learn from books or courses. So, thank you again for this!

Extensions - I really wanted to develop a webapp/GUI of this program, but it was a bit tight to first learn and then implement this. I did learn Tkinter to develop a GUI for this and got started, but I couldn't finish in time. And as for the webapp, I got started with flask, but I think I need to learn database stuff to fully implement it. I have much confusion, so I'll probably need a week more to learn enough HTML, CSS, and flask to implement a full fledged web app. But what I did is write a code that posts the most retweeted tweets of Kanye/Elon from my own account--a tiny step at creating 'Kanlon' :) . And I'm brainstorming ideas about how to extend the code. So, I'll keep working on it more.
